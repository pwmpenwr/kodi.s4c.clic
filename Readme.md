# Kodi video add-on for accessing S4C Clic content

This add-on uses Roman_V_M's video plugin sample and adds simple scraping code to extract programme and episode data
from the S4C Clic website.

It is particularly useful for low-bandwidth connections where i-player produces a stop-start viewing experience. To get
best results (with a 1MB/s link), I found that setting the maximum bandwidth consumption for Kodi at 512kB/s gave
uninterrupted although lower quality viewing. The viewing was very watchable however (especially as it is only a 1MB/s
link).

This has been tested only on Kodi 16.1 (Jarvis) on a Raspberry Pi 1.

I anticipate trying to keep up-to-date with any Clic website changes (trying to learn Welsh) but there may be a delay
if something serious happens.

**Warning**: the video sample code is only compatible with Kody 16.0 (Jarvis) and above. For older versions see the
"legacy" branch of Roman_V_M's plugin.
